- [2025-11-08 04:08:53] [WARNING] public-apis: CoinCap fetch failed: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='api.coincap.io', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /v2/assets?limit=25 (Caused by NameResolutionError("<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x72a2d64535f0>: Failed to resolve 'api.coincap.io' ([Errno -2] Name or service not known)"))
- [2025-11-08 04:08:10] [ERROR] market-data: failed to persist prices: bad parameter or other API misuse
Instructions:
1. Fix any errors found in the logs by making meaningful upgrades while following a fix/test/fix/test loop.
2. Answer the following question:
"What are 10 improvements to make for this system to (A) enhance it toward equilibrium in producing the most accurate crypto price and volume predictions for windows from 5 minutes to 6 months—from the current data stream onward—while finding buy-low/sell-high opportunities and scheduling them in ghost and live trading with 15% of each profitable swap flowing into stablecoin savings once Nash equilibrium is reached; (B) operate efficiently on an i5 CPU with 32GB RAM without downgrading functionality or accuracy—only more efficient engineering; (C) draw on additional ethical, free news sources at arbitrary dates, scrape/store them per design, and inject them into model training; (D) fix errors as you go using a fix/test loop running all relevant unit tests for changed components)."
3. Implement those improvements.
4. After each fix, run the relevant tests (unit tests, lab regression, etc.) and report the results.
5. Stop only after all items are addressed or when manual approval is required.
